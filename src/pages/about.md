I'm a student web developer creating websites for fun. I started programming back in [5th grade](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/sillyangel3), and since then, i have learned many things along the way.

currently, im focusing mainly on **UI design**, and i occasionally work with tools like [Next.js](https://preview-stil.vercel.app).

outside of coding, i love to listen to music.
